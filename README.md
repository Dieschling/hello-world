# hello-world
First Github repository for me :p

I edit this file to test the branching and to get along with github. At work we use another versioning-software, but github will be for my personal projects. :)

And after a long time I checked it out with TortoiseSVN. Or just Subversion? I don't know the words. Let's try commiting.
